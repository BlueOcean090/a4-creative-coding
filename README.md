## The Roll



- to play a very specific song with an audio visualizer in different colors and sizes with pause play ability
- there was supposed to be a boombox but the web audio api is like wizardry for me, so I couldn't tell what the scripts were doing so canvas manipulation is where we are 
- the audio visualizer doesn't show if either of the colors are not selected and the pause play requires an additional click on the first use
- honesly this was much more stressful than I was advertised
